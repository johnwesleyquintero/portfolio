# Code Review Report

## Critical Issues

### 1. Outdated Dependencies

- Next.js version 15.2.4 is specified, but this appears to be incorrect as the latest stable version is 14.x
- Several other dependencies have potential security or compatibility issues:
  - eslint v9.23.0 (latest stable is 8.x)
  - postcss v8.5.3 (latest stable is 8.4.x)

### 2. Error Handling Issues

- ErrorBoundary component uses window.addEventListener which won't catch render errors
- Custom event handling for CSV parsing errors could be improved
- Missing cleanup for some event listeners
- No proper TypeScript typing for custom events

### 3. Performance Concerns

- Dynamic imports in layout.tsx could be optimized
- Multiple state updates in error handling could cause unnecessary rerenders

### 4. Edge Cases Not Handled

- No offline fallback
- Missing loading states for dynamic imports
- No retry mechanism for failed data fetches

### 5. Best Practices Violations

- Inconsistent error logging strategy
- Missing error boundaries at critical section levels
- Type definitions could be more strict

## Recommendations

1. Update package.json with correct dependency versions
2. Implement proper React Error Boundary pattern
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Implement proper loading states
5. Add retry mechanisms for network requests
6. Improve TypeScript types

## Next Steps

Immediate actions needed:

1. Fix dependency versions
2. Refactor ErrorBoundary component
3. Add proper error handling for dynamic imports

Changes implemented:

1. ✅ Fixed dependency versions in package.json
2. ✅ Created enhanced error boundary with proper React patterns
3. ✅ Optimized dynamic imports with better loading states
4. ✅ Added retry mechanisms and error utilities
5. ✅ Created global error page for Next.js
6. ✅ Added loading spinner component
7. ✅ Implemented proper TypeScript typing
8. ✅ Added network error handling with retry mechanism
9. ✅ Created utilities for API calls with automatic retries

Additional recommendations:

1. Add comprehensive unit tests
2. Implement logging service
3. Add performance monitoring
4. Consider implementing service worker for offline support
5. Add automated dependency updates with Dependabot
