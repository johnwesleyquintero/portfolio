# Error Guide

When you see messages like:

- **Found 159 errors in 32 files.**
- **Errors  Files**

please note that these messages are generated during the build/compilation process. They indicate that there are type, lint, or runtime errors across various files.

## Steps to Diagnose & Fix

1. **Review the Terminal Output:**  
   Run the build or `tsc` command to see the detailed error output.

2. **Check Individual Files:**  
   The error output will list affected file paths and line numbers. Review each file and fix errors as indicated by the messages.

3. **Linting:**  
   Run the linter (e.g., `eslint`) to see any formatting or coding standard issues.

4. **Refer to Documentation:**  
   For more information on TypeScript errors, see [TypeScript Troubleshooting](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html)  
   For linting errors, refer to the [ESLint documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/).

## Additional Error Handling for Seller Tools

Several seller tools (e.g., CSV Uploaders, FBA Calculator, and Sales Estimator) now include enhanced error handling and validation. If you encounter errors during CSV processing or data calculations, please:
- Check both the browser console and any error messages displayed by error boundaries.
- Refer to the relevant tool documentation for expected CSV formats.
- Review the code comments in components (such as error-boundary.tsx and app/error.tsx) for additional debugging guidance.

Following these steps should help pinpoint issues and resolve the errors.

Happy coding!
