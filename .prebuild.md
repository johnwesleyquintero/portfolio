### Comprehensive `pnpm` Prebuild Process

```sh
pnpm prebuild
```

```text
"prebuild": "pnpm run format && pnpm run type-check && pnpm run lint:strict && next build",
```

#### Objective

This document outlines the comprehensive `pnpm` build process, ensuring code quality and consistency. The build process includes formatting, type-checking, and linting for all TypeScript (`.ts`, `.tsx`) files within the project directory and its subdirectories. The process halts immediately upon detecting any errors. Verbose output is enabled to display all formatting changes, linting violations, and type errors.

#### Build Steps

1.  **Format Code:**

    ```sh
    pnpm format
    ```

    *   **Description:** Formats all TypeScript files using Prettier, ensuring consistent code style. The command displays the changes made.

2.  **Type-Check Code:**

    ```sh
    pnpm type-check
    ```

    *   **Description:** Checks for type errors in all TypeScript files using the TypeScript compiler. If errors are encountered, the build process will halt.

    *   **Error Handling:** If type-checking fails, the following message will be displayed:

        ```
        Type Check Failed
        ```

        Potential causes and troubleshooting actions:

        *   **Incorrect TypeScript configuration:** Review `tsconfig.json` for any misconfigurations.
        *   **Missing type definitions:** Install necessary type definition packages (e.g., `@types/react`).
        *   **Import issues:** Verify all imports are correct and that the modules are installed.
        *   **Outdated dependencies:** Update project dependencies using `pnpm update`.

3.  **Lint Code:**

    ```sh
    pnpm lint:strict
    ```

    *   **Description:** Lints all TypeScript files using ESLint with a strict configuration. The command displays any linting violations, including rule names, severity, and exact locations of violations.

4.  **Build Application:**

    ```sh
    next build
    ```

    *   **Description:** Builds the Next.js application, optimizing the code for production.

#### Output Requirements

*   **Formatting Changes:** Display all changes made by Prettier during the formatting step.
*   **Linting Violations:** Show rule names, severity levels (e.g., error, warning), and the exact file path, line number, and column number of each violation.
*   **Type Errors:** Pinpoint the exact file path, line number, and column number for each type error.

#### Error Handling

*   The build process will halt immediately if any errors are detected during formatting, type-checking, or linting.
*   Specific error messages and troubleshooting steps are provided for type-checking failures, as detailed in the "Type-Check Code" step.

#### Best Practices and Patterns

*   **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The build process is broken down into distinct steps (format, type-check, lint, build), each with a specific responsibility.
*   **Early Error Detection:** Type-checking and linting are performed before the build step to catch errors early in the development cycle.
*   **Automated Formatting:** Prettier ensures consistent code style across the project.
*   **Strict Linting Rules:** The `lint:strict` command enforces a high level of code quality.
*   **Verbose Output:** Detailed output from each step provides valuable information for debugging and troubleshooting.

#### Performance Optimization

*   The use of `next build` optimizes the Next.js application for production, including code minification, tree-shaking, and other performance enhancements.
*   The build process is designed to be efficient, with each step focusing on a specific task.

#### Maintainability

*   The documentation is well-structured and easy to understand.
*   The build process is automated, reducing the risk of manual errors.
*   The use of standard tools (Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript) makes the project easier to maintain and understand for other developers.
