# â–² Design Guidelines

## Goal:

---

### Project Overview

Given that this is a real web application embedded in my portfolio, let's develop our own advanced algorithm utilities across all tools, adhering to Amazon's standards and best practices. This will ensure we stay ahead of existing SaaS tools. Our goal is to streamline the workflow for sellers and brand managers, reducing the need for manual data analysis in Google Sheets or Excel. Instead, they can use our tool to gain insights and recommendations, which can then be exported and integrated into their files with robust and reliable outputs.

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Duplicate UI Components:**
   - Identify and remove redundant UI components.

2. **Duplicate Utility Files:**
   - Identify and remove duplicated utility files.

3. **Unused UI Components:**
   - Review and remove unused UI components that are no longer required or used.

4. **Unused Utility Functions:**
   - Review and remove unused utility functions that are no longer required or used.

5. **Improve Code Readability:**
   - Refactor the codebase to improve readability and maintainability.

### Redesign and Refactor the Amazon Seller Tools Suite

Focus on creating a modern, intuitive, and data-driven user experience. This includes:

1. **Enhanced Data Visualization:**
   - Integrate interactive, dynamic charts and graphs within each tool to facilitate in-depth data analysis and reporting.
   - Charts should support drill-down capabilities, customizable views, and real-time data updates.

2. **Robust Data Export:**
   - Implement comprehensive data export functionality across all tools, supporting a wide range of file formats (e.g., CSV, Excel, PDF, JSON).
   - Include customizable export options (e.g., date ranges, specific data fields).

3. **Intuitive Navigation & Information Architecture:**
   - Redesign the navigation structure for improved discoverability and ease of use.
   - Implement a clear and consistent information architecture across all tools.

4. **Responsive Design & Accessibility:**
   - Ensure a fully responsive design that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices.
   - Adhere to WCAG guidelines for accessibility compliance, ensuring usability for all users.

5. **Code Refactoring & Reusability:**
   - Refactor the codebase for improved maintainability and scalability.
   - Identify and implement reusable UI components and utility functions to eliminate code duplication and promote consistency.

6. **Duplication Elimination & UI Enhancement:**
   - Identify and remove redundant code and UI elements.
   - Enhance existing UI elements for improved visual appeal, clarity, and user interaction.

### Next Steps

Implement these improvements systematically across all tools while maintaining existing functionality.

**_Let's use pnpm for consistency across our projects._**

**Package Manager Enforcement**

- All contributors must use PNPM (v8.15.0+)
- Lockfile (pnpm-lock.yaml) must be committed
- Use workspace protocol for internal dependencies
- `engine-strict=true` in .npmrc

## Overview

This document outlines the design guidelines for the application.

## Scope

The scope of the application is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly website.

## Core Principles

- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent visual style throughout the application.
- **Readability**: Ensure that the codebase is easy to read and understand.
- **Modularity**: Break down complex components into smaller, reusable parts.

## Design Requirements

### Visual Design

- Create visually stunning and unique interfaces.
- Implement modern design principles.
- Add thoughtful animations.
- Design intuitive user experiences.
- Ensure responsive layouts.

### Technical Stack

- **Next.js 14** with App Router structure:
  - `/app` directory for pages and layouts
  - Server Components by default
  - Client Components when needed
- **Tailwind CSS** with:
  - Custom theme configuration
  - Responsive design utilities
  - Dark mode support
- **UI Components**:
  - ShadCN/ui components for consistent UI
  - Custom components in `/components` directory
- **Icons**:
  - Lucide React icons for UI elements
  - Custom SVG icons when needed
- **State Management**:
  - React Context for theme management
  - Server-side data fetching

### Project Structure

- `/app` - Next.js 14 app router pages and layouts
- `/components` - Reusable UI components and tools
- `/data` - JSON data files for content
- `/lib` - Utility functions and configuration
- `/public` - Static assets and images
- `/styles` - Global styles and Tailwind config

### Assets & Resources

#### Icons

- Use Lucide React icons for:
  - Logos
  - UI elements
- Maintain visual consistency.

#### Images

- Source: Unsplash (verified URLs only).
- Implementation:
  - Use Next.js Image component
  - Include loading states
  - Add fallbacks
  - Optimize for web performance

### Quality Standards

- Production-ready features
- Proper error handling
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- Performance optimization (Lighthouse scores)
- Cross-browser compatibility
- TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
